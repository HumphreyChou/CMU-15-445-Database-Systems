# CMU 15-445 Database Systems

This repository contains slides, notes and assignments for the course [Database Systems](https://15445.courses.cs.cmu.edu/fall2019/) fall  2019  

Besides, this course includes a wonderful series of projects based on an educational database called BusTub. You can check my implementation [here](https://github.com/HumphreyChou/bustub) but you are not supposed to do it if you are a CMU student.
